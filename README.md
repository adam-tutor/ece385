# ece385
Final Project for ECE385 - Designing Pac-Man on an FPGA Board from Scratch (SystemVerilog)

Given the limitations of both SystemVerilog and the FPGA Board itself, a lot of features of Pac-Man as well as compatibility for peripherals were programmed from scratch in SystemVerilog.
The following were designed and programmed by Adam Tutor and Alexis Santos:

  USB Keyboard protocol
  Standard VGA controller protocol
  A/D and D/A conversion
  2-1, 4-1, 5-1 MUXs
  NIOS II soft-CPU based ystem-on-chip platform
  Simplified LC-3 microprocessor
  
  Collision detection
  Custom sprites
  Mapping algorithm (from sprite sheet to screen)
  Color mapping
  Functioning scoreboard and counter
  Ghost behavior
  Collectable pellets and pellet count
